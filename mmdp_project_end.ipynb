    "Multimodal learning is a branch of deep learning that combines and processes multiple types of data-called modalities-such as images, audio, text, or, in our case, RGB (color) and depth information. The goal: to help AI models better understand the world by leveraging complementary cues from different data sources.\n",

    "## üåà From Unimodal to Multimodal Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time, object recognition lived in a *flat* world‚Äîfocused solely on RGB images. These early systems could \"see\" color and texture but were easily fooled by the messiness of reality:  \n",

    "## Method Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach is built on the idea that **two eyes see better than one**-especially when those \"eyes\" are a color camera and a depth sensor. Our system uses a **dual-path neural network** inspired by  to process RGB and depth data separately before fusing their insights. Here‚Äôs how we fuse their strengths for robust object recognition: \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dual Streams:**  \n",
    "  We use two separate CNNs: one processes the RGB (color) image, and the other processes the depth image. Each stream learns to extract features unique to its modality-texture and color from RGB, shape and geometry from depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth Encoding:**  \n",
    "  Standard CNNs are designed for 3-channel (RGB) inputs. To make depth data compatible, we **colorize the depth image** using a jet colormap, spreading its values across three channels. This clever trick lets us use powerful, pre-trained CNNs for both streams-even though large labeled depth datasets are rare[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Late Fusion Strategy:**  \n",
    "Instead of merging information at the input or early layers, each stream learns features independently. The outputs of both streams are then combined in a late fusion layer-a fully connected layer that merges the learned representations from both modalities. This allows the network to learn the most relevant combination of features for object recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Robustness via Data Augmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Realistic Noise:**  \n",
    "  Real-world sensors are imperfect. We simulate this by corrupting depth images with realistic noise patterns during training. This makes our model more resilient to occlusions, missing data, and sensor artifacts-challenges that are common outside the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stage-Wise Training:**  \n",
    "1. **Individual Stream Training:**  \n",
    "   Each stream (RGB and depth) is first trained separately, initialized with ImageNet weights for maximum transfer learning benefit.\n",
    "2. **Joint Fine-Tuning:**  \n",
    "   The two streams are then joined via the fusion layer and fine-tuned together, optimizing the entire network for the RGB-D object recognition task.\n",
